### <a name="_xk9asle1vad4"></a>**Project Overview ðŸ“„**
**Overview**

- **Project Name:** ChainPort: The Ultimate Security-Centric Cross-Chain Bridge.
- **Project Description:** ChainPort is a live, production-ready cross-chain bridge focused on providing custodian-level security for asset transfers. Currently operational on over 30 blockchains, our platform is trusted by 130,000 users and secures $180M in TVL. We propose to integrate Polymesh into the ChainPort bridge, connecting its regulated asset ecosystem to our extensive network.
- **Polymesh Integration:** This project will enable the secure and seamless bi-directional transfer of assets between Polymesh and the 30+ other chains in our network. This will allow tokenized securities and other regulated assets on Polymesh to access liquidity from major ecosystems like Ethereum, and for assets from other chains to be securely brought into the compliant Polymesh environment.
- **Team Interest:** We are interested in this project because we see a critical need for secure interoperability in the regulated asset space. By bridging Polymesh, we can provide essential infrastructure that enhances its utility and connects its unique, compliance-focused ecosystem to the broader world of digital assets.

### <a name="_l2bhv3im8cbi"></a>**Project Details**
- **UI Components:** Our live application serves as the design basis for the integration. The UI is user-friendly and has been refined based on feedback from our 130,000+ users.[ ](https://app.chainport.io/)[**Live App:**](https://app.chainport.io/)[ https://app.chainport.io/](https://app.chainport.io/)
- **Architecture:** ChainPort is a security-first custodial bridge. We secure assets using cold storage token vaults via **Fireblocks** and **Gnosis Safe**. Our infrastructure is built on battle-tested smart contracts that have undergone multiple third-party audits from industry leaders like Zokyo, Trail of Bits, and Certik.
- **Technology Stack:** Our stack is chain-agnostic, enabling efficient integration with diverse blockchain architectures. For Polymesh, we will deploy our audited smart contracts to manage the secure locking, minting, and burning of assets, connecting them to our robust backend infrastructure.
- **Prior Work (MVP):** The entire ChainPort platform is a live MVP that has been in production since 2021. It is a mature, stable, and secure product.
- **Limitations:** ChainPort is currently a **closed-source** project for security reasons. The integration will not include Polymesh-specific features beyond the secure bridging of assets unless explicitly scoped during technical due diligence.

### <a name="_fpmsy9d14r51"></a>**Ecosystem Fit**
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?\
  ChainPort will serve as a critical piece of interoperability infrastructure for the Polymesh ecosystem. It will act as a secure gateway, connecting Polymesh to the vast liquidity and user bases of over 30 other blockchains.
- Who is your target audience?\
  Our target audience includes token issuers on Polymesh, institutional participants, and the broader Polymesh user base who wish to move assets into or out of the ecosystem securely. We also target users from other chains who want to access the unique regulated assets available on Polymesh.
- What need(s) does your project meet?\
  The project meets the critical need for secure cross-chain liquidity and asset transferability for regulated digital assets. It solves the problem of ecosystem isolation, allowing Polymesh to interact with the broader Web3 landscape.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polymesh ecosystem?\
  To our knowledge, there are no other projects in the Polymesh ecosystem that offer the same level of security, broad chain support (30+ chains, including non-EVMs), and proven track record as ChainPort.
- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?\
  Yes, there are many cross-chain bridges in the broader Web3 ecosystem. ChainPort differentiates itself through its uncompromising focus on security (custodian-level cold storage, multiple audits) and its extensive, established network of integrated chains.

### <a name="_kqkn7mpruezs"></a>**Development Status ðŸ“–**
ChainPort is a fully developed, live, and mature project that has been in production since 2021. This proposal is not for building a new product from scratch but for **integrating the Polymesh blockchain into our existing, proven infrastructure**. We have a well-defined process for integrating new chains and have successfully done so with grant support from numerous other ecosystems.
